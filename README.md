# Python 3 Cheatsheet

#### Fundamentals

## Comments
```
# comments are done using the hashtag 
'''
multi
line 
comments are done using triple quotes (could be single or double quote)
'''
```

##Assignment and Variables
The types of variables are not explicitly defined, the type is implicit. Variables can be assigned to other types. There is no keyword to declare a variable.
```
y = 3
y = "string"
y = ['2',44,'hello']
```

##Math Operators
```
>>> 10 / 2 # regular division (converts to float)
... 5.0
>>> 10 // 2 # floor division 
... 5
>>> 10 - 2 # substraction
... 8
>>> 10 + 2 # addition
... 12
>>> 10 * 2 # multiplication
... 20
>>> 10 ** 2 # powers
... 100
```

####Control Flow

##if, elif, else
if is one of the most recognizable statements in programming. It appears in some capacitity in 
almost every programming language.

```
x = 10
if x<3:
	print('x is smaller than 3')
elif x==3:
	print('x is 3')
else:
	print('x is more than 3')
# x is more than 3
```

##for
```
words = ['hello', 'python','coders']
for word in words:
	print(word)
```


##while, break, continue

##try, except, finally

##pass

##functions

####Basic Types

##Booleans

##Numbers

##Strings

##Lists

##Tuples

##Sets

##Dictionaries


####Data Types

####File IO

####Object-Oriented Programming
